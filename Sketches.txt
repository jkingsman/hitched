FAQ

Why not take same last name?
(Because changing one's name has no bearing on two people who love each other -- not important for either of us to express our love)

When can we expect little Mastenettes and Kingsmanlets?
No children for us, please! We're happy to be aunt and uncle, or, if Matti's siblings follow in our footsteps, those friendly neighbors with the pool and cool video games.
